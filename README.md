# Student Grade Calculator (C++)

A simple program that calculates a student's final grade based on quizzes, exams, and project scores. This project was originally created as an assignment and later refined into a portfolio project for GitHub.

## Description

The program asks the user to enter:
- Three quiz scores
- One midterm exam score
- Two long exam scores
- One project score

It then computes the following:
- Quiz Average
- Long Exam Average
- Final Grade (weighted: 30% Midtem, 30% Long Exam Average, 15% Quiz Average, and 25% Project)

This project is useful for learning:
- Basic C++ syntax
- Input/Output operations
- Arithmetic operations
- Use of `iomanip` for formatted output

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++, MSVC, or dev-c++)
- Works on Windows, Linux, or macOS

### Installing

1. Clone the repository or download the `.cpp` file.
2. Open the file in your preferred IDE (Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, or VSCode) or text editor.

### Executing Program

To compile and run using **g++**:

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o grade_calculator
.grade/calculator

Then follow the prompts to enter quiz, exam, and project scores.
```

## Help
- Make sure your C++ compiler is installd and added to your PATH.
- If the program doesn't run, check for typos when compiling (`main.cpp` vs. your actual filename).
